### Arrays-Practice-Questions

1. Write a program to create an integer array to store 5 integers. Accept the five integer values from user and print
   them on console.
2. Write a program to create an integer array and initialize it with values `{51, 100, 2, 8 , 45, 7}`.
   Print the size of array using length property of array and also calculate and print the sum and average of all the
   elements of the array.
3. Write a program to create an integer array and initialize it with values `{51, 100, 2, 8 , 45, 7}`. Print all the
   even element of the array.
4. Write a program to create an integer array and initialize it with values `{51, 100, 2, 8 , 45, 7}`. Increase the
   value of all the odd elements of the array and
   decrease the value of all the even elements of the array.
5. Write a program to create an integer array by accepting the size of the array from user. Initialize the array by
   accepting values from user.
   Find the maximum element from the array and print it on console.
    ```text
    Sample run
    int[] numbers = {51, 100, 2, 8 , 45, 7};
    maximum = 100
    ```
6. Write a program to create an integer array by accepting the size of the array from user. Initialize the array by
   accepting values from user.
   Accept `searchElement` form the user and search for `searchElement` in the array. If element present in array print
   found otherwise not found.
    ```text
    Sample run
    int[] numbers = {51, 100, 2, 8 , 45, 7};
    int searchElement = 7;
    
    Output
    Found
    ```
7. Write a program to create an integer array by accepting the size of the array from user. Initialize the array by
   accepting values from user.
   Accept `searchElement` form the user and search for `searchElement` in the array. If element present in array print
   the index on which it is present otherwise print -1.
    ```text
    Sample run1
    int[] numbers = {51, 100, 2, 8 , 45, 7};
    int searchElement = 7;
    
    Output
    index = 5
   
    Sample run2
    int[] numbers = {51, 100, 2, 8 , 45, 7};
    int searchElement = 10;
    
    Output
    index = -1
    ```
8. Write a program to create an integer array by accepting the size of the array from user. Initialize the array by
   accepting values from user.
   Find the minimum element from the array and print it on console.
    ```text
    Sample run
    int[] numbers = {51, 100, 2, 8 , 45, 7};
    minimum = 2
    ```
9. Write a program to create an integer array by accepting the size of the array from user. Initialize the array by
   accepting values from user.
   Find the index of minimum and maximum element from the array and print it on console.
    ```text
    Sample run
    int[] numbers = {51, 100, 2, 8 , 45, 7};
    indexOfMinimumElement = 2
    indexOfMaximumElement = 1
    ```
